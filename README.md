# SmartFireAlarm

# Description of the project

### Problem

Fire alarms detect the fire after it started, after that point fire damages properties and human lives. Preventing fire from happening is the real challenge and since most of the causes leading to the fire can be monitored we wanted to detect the possibility of fire.

### Solution

We used smoke sensor for detecting the fire situation and gas sensor, temperature, humidity sensor for detecting possibility of fire and warn people about the situation and the cause of the fire possibility and if fire detected the sound the alarms.
